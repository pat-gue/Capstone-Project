Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate Capstone Project



Summary
This case study by Patrick D. Gueta is the final __capstone project__ on the course _Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate_ where students are asked to do a (close to) real life project to showcase the skills they acquired in the courses. I choose the __Cyclistic Bike-Share Case Study__. The data has been made available by __Motivate International Inc.__ under this [license.](https://ride.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement)


Scenario

I am a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director
of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore,
your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights,
your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.  \

But first, Cyclistic executives
must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data
visualizations.


In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that
are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and
returned to any other station in the system anytime.  \

Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments.
One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes,
and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers
who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.  \

Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Although the
pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers, Lily Moreno(Cyclistic’s director of marketing) believes that maximizing the number of annual members will
be key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, Moreno believes there is a
very good chance to convert casual riders into members. She notes that casual riders are already aware of the Cyclistic
program and have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs.  \

Lily Moreno has asked the marketing analyst team (of which I am a junior analyst learning the ropes) to design strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. Lily has asked these questions:

1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

As the Junior Data Analyst of the Marketing Analyst team, Morena has asked me to tackle the first question.

_1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?_   \
